Write a shell script, that expects a .txt file and a number as arguments and adds up the numbers greater than the given number as argument  
and writes the sum to the .txt file.  
(eg.: [in file sumgreaterTest.txt: 1 2 3] --> ./sumgreater.ps1 sumgreaterTest.txt 1 --> Output: 5 and [in file sumgreaterTest.txt: 1 2 3 5])  

4. Task:  
Write a shell script, that expects a .txt file as an argument and switches the number 5, 50 and 500 to five, fifty and fivehundred.
